# Note Taker

A simple note taker

Bootcamp Challenge 11: Express

Description


This application was crafted to provide users with a dedicated space for storing notes, aiding in the organization of thoughts and task management. It leverages Express and JavaScript, employing a simulated database through a JSON file (db.json) for the storage and retrieval of data.

Installation

1. Clone the Repository. 
2. Open VSCode and run npm install in the integrated terminal.
3. Run the application by typing the command node server.js or npm start in the terminal.


Usage

To initiate the server, go to the application directory, install all dependencies using npm install, and then execute the command npm start (or node index.js). You should see a message in the command line indicating "App listening at http://localhost:3001 ðŸš€". Once the server is active, you can access the application's front end directly from the command line by holding down the command key and clicking on the link http://localhost:3001.
